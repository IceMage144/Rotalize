# Rotalize

Our aim is to create a site where you can create and manage your own travel itinerary. With Rotalize you will be able to keep your travel plans anywhere you may go.

## Tools:
Web application framework: Ruby on Rails
Database management system: PostgreSQL
Containerization tool: Docker

## Documentation:
Documentation can be found at the [project wiki](https://github.com/IceMage144/Rotalize/wiki).

## Installing and running the project in development environment:
**Prerequisite:** [Download and install docker-compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-16-04).

Run:
```
sudo docker-compose build

sudo docker-compose up
```
Now you can access the application at localhost:3000 .
You may have to disable postgresql by running :
```
systemctl stop postgresql
```
